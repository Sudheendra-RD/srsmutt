Sree Raghavendra Swamy, the great mystic saint is the 17th descendant in the lineage of Sri Madhwacharya, is the exponent of Dwaitha philosophy. He is an incarnation of Bhakta Prahalada, who while entering into “Samadhi” alive in 1671 A.D. assured his devotees of his beneficence for the next 700 years. Since then, Countless devotees have been the recipients of his grace and benediction. Sri Raghavendra Theertha – the patron Saint at Mantralayam is verily the Wishing tree (Kalpa Vruksha), the divine cow (Kamadhenu) and the divine Jewel (chintamani), all in one, fulfilling the righteous desires of all who visit Mantralayam and pray for his benign benevolence.

Sri Raghavendra Swamy Matha owns a very big Go-Shala named KAMADHENU GOSHALA. Stretching around 20 acres of land (Cow yard) at the outskirts of Mantralayam, this GoShala shelters several Milking and non-milking cows here.

All the gods are believed to reside in the body of Kamadhenu — the divine cow. Her four legs are the scriptural Vedas; her horns are the triune gods Brahma (tip), Vishnu (middle) and Shiva (base); her eyes are the sun and moon gods, her shoulders the fire-god Agni and the wind-god Vayu and her legs the Himalayas. Kamadhenu is often depicted in this form in poster art.

In Brihat Parashara Smriti (5.26-27) it is said that one who feeds the cow with grass and water every day derives the benefit equivalent to performing Ashwamedha Yajna.
