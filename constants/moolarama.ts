Sri Vijayadasa has composed the separate Suladi depicting the events leading to the possession of these idols.

Chathurmukha Brahma rejoices in worshipping God in different ways.These idols were made by Vishwakarma as ordained by Chathurmukha Brahma for the purpose of daily pooja. After worshipping them for a long time, Chathurmukha Brahma handed over to Jabalamuni for the benefit of the world.

King Ikshvaku of Surya dynastymade this idols as his kuladevathas and worshipped them.His descendents in the dynasty, Mandhatha, Anaranya, Thrishanku, Harischandra, Sagara, Bhageertha, Ambareesha, Dilipa and other emperors also worshipped these idols.

Thus, it is needless to say how immense the divine presence is in the idols worshipped by such great souls.when the truth प्रतिमायन्तु सान्निध्य्म् अर्चकस्य तपोबलात्। is analysed, it is only appropriate to consider these idols as the real Lord keeping in mind particularly the fact that they were worshipped by none other than Laxmi and Narayana, the supreme spirit of the universe, Brahma and by Vayu in all his three incarnations. It can be so said here लोहवद्रुयते हरिः। as शिलावद्रुयते हरिः।I said in Tirupathi. Those who merely touch such sacred idols are the righteous and the vortuous. Puranas quote that the worshippers of these idols are above human and “Amshapurushas”. The very darshan of the aslant Lord Rama with drooping ears on a round base is magnificent. There is no doubt about just a darshan of a Lord purging us of the heap of our sins.Only to worship this idol, Vyasamuni became Raghavendra, Vibhudhendra-Vijayeendra, Jithamitra-Sudheendra. In the opinion of the jnanis anyone who worships this idol in Yathyasharma is certain to attain salvation. It can be definitely said that the Almighty has blessed this world with this idol for emancipation of his devotees in an age beset with sin. Sri Moola rama even today has enshrined Sri Raghavendra Swamy Mutt, the original samsthana of Acharya.
